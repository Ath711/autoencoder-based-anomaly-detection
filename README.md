# Autoencoder Anomaly Detection

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script for implementing anomaly detection using autoencoders on a credit card fraud dataset. The code covers data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model architecture, training, and evaluation.

## Files

- `autoencoder_anomaly_detection.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the complete code for anomaly detection.
- `creditcard.csv`: Dataset file containing credit card transaction data. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## Instructions

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (`pip install torch scikit-learn pandas seaborn matplotlib`).
2. Run the `autoencoder_anomaly_detection.ipynb` notebook in your prefered environment.

## Results

The script outputs a classification report and plots the training loss over epochs, providing insights into the model's performance.

Feel free to explore and adapt the code to your specific use case.
